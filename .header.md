## Cisco Secure Firewall deployment in AWS in a Centralized and Distributed Architecture with GWLB using Terrform - Templates

## Overview

This solution can be used to learn how to deploy Cisco Secure Firewall in an AWS environment as target devices to AWS Gateway Loadbalancer in order to inspect traffic to and from the applications running in AWS based on the usecases.
The solution makes use of Cisco Secure Firewall AWS Terraform module, AWS Terraform provider, Cisco FMC Terraform provider and CDO Terraform to deploy the required resources, register the deployed FTDv instances to FMC (FMCv in AWS or cdFMC) and configure the required features on FMC.

Examples for the following usecases are provided to help you in your deployment in the **examples** folder:

- Centralized Architecture with existing service and existing spoke VPC with FMC
- Centralized Architecture with existing service and new spoke VPC with FMC
- Centralized Architecture with new service and new spoke VPC with Cloud-delivered FMC
- Distributed Architecture with outbound traffic
- Distributed Architecture with inbound traffic
- Multi VPC hub and spoke architecture for east-west traffic inspection

Note: The terraform example in the root folder is for the usecase `Centralized Architecture with existing service and new spoke VPC with FMC`
