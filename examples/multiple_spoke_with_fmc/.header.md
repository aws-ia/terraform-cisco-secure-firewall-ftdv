# AWS GWLB Centralized Architecture setup with Cisco Secure Firewall in Multiple Spoke Environment

## Overview

Using this Terraform template following resources will be created:

### Service VPC

- Mgmt, Diag, Outside, Inside subnets per AZ
- One Gateway Load balancer
- 2 Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) as GWLB Targets
- 1 TGW subnet per AZ
- Default route in TGW subnet route table to Gateway Load balancer Endpoint
- Gateway Load balancer Endpoint(GWLBE) subnets per AZ
- Spoke VPC 1 subnet route in GWLBE to Transit Gateway
- Spoke VPC 2 subnet route in GWLBE to Transit Gateway

### Spoke VPC 1

- 1 Spoke VPC with 2 subnets in different AZ

### Spoke VPC 2

- 1 Spoke VPC with 2 subnets in different AZ

### Transit Gateway

- One Transit Gateway
- Attachments for Transit Gateway to service and the 2 spoke vpc
- Transit Gateway Routing table for each attachements

### Terrform for FMC configuration

All the configuration on the Firewall Management Center are done by using the Cisco FMC Terraform Provider.
Note: The following FMC configuration is an example configuration making use of the evaluation license. If there are more than 2 FTDv instances deployed then additional "fmc_devices" resources need to be added in the "main.tf" file.

FMC Terraform provider is used to configure the following on the FMC

- FTD Device Registration
- Interface Configuration
- VTEP
- VNI Interface
- NAT rules for health check (conditional)
- Access Policy
- Access Rule to allow health check probe traffic (conditional)
- Inside subnet Gateway Network object

Note: After the deployment a default route to the transit gateway need to be added in the spoke subnet route table.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following:

- Terraform â€“ Learn how to download and set up [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html).
- Programmatic access to AWS account with CLI - learn how to set up [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)

- Service VPC with a subnet created
- A Keypair should be created on AWS and referenced here
- A Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) in Service VPC with security groups attached allowing HTTPS traffic and traffic from Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense.

## Cleanup

To destroy the resources created on AWS and FMC run the following command
`terraform destroy`
